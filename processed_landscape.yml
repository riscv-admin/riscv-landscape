              µRV32 is a bundle of a SpinalHDL based RTL implementation of the RISC-V ISA and a SystemC TLM 2.0 based VP of the RTL model. The platform is built
              for the use on FPGAs and aims for research and educational use. The VP enables fast development and design exploration cycles for software
              development and hardware extensions of the ISA or the platform.

              The AIRISC family of RISC-V cores developed by Fraunhofer IMS enables efficient machine learning and AI in sensors, IoT devices, and other
              embedded applications. AIRISC variants with extended safety mechanisms such as dual-core lock-stepping (DCLS) or error correcting codes (ECC) are
              available for use in fail-safe systems according to ISO 26262 (up to ASIL-D) and DIN 61508.


              The AIRISC Core Complex is based on a 32-bit RISC-V CPU compatible to the RISC-V unprivileged and privileged specifications also supporting the
              RISC-V External Debug specification. The CPU implements a Harvard architecture with a four-level pipeline and separate AHB-Lite interfaces for
              instruction fetch and data access. The core's RV32I_Zicsr base ISA can be further extended via a unified co-processor interface (PCPI).

            description: >-
              Implementing security functions require high-level abstractions of the hardware, typically provided by an Operating System (OS). Because the
              correctness of the security functions depends on the correctness of these high-level abstractions, the OS that implements them should be free from
              exploitable vulnerabilities.


              The secure OS needs to be of the highest software quality possible and be as close as possible to zero defect. To meet that goal, the only
              available strategy to date is to develop the OS using deductive formal methods.


              This is why ProvenRun has developed ProvenCore, an formally proven ultra secure OS/TEE. It is a key milestone for being able to develop
              secure-by-design connected devices in many sectors (automotive, railways, aeronautics, energy, industrial, medical, etc.), in a cost effective
              way.

            description: >-
              The PX5 RTOS features a native implementation of the industry standard POSIX pthreads API as well as best-of-class size and performance. As for
              safety and security, the PX5 RTOS provides Pointer/Data Verification (PDV) technology, which developers can leverage at run-time to verify
              function return addresses, function pointers, system objects, global data, and memory pools. This technology is unique to the PX5 RTOS. In
              addition to the native POSIX pthread support (semaphore, mutex, message queue, etc.), the PX5 RTOS also offers real-time extensions such as event
              flags, fast queues, tick timers, memory management, and more. Given the PX5 RTOS industry-standard POSIX pthreads API support, a wide range of
              software stacks are instantly enabled – both open source and commercial – for real-time embedded IoT platforms.

              XtratuM Next Generation (XNG) is an embedded ECSS category B qualified type 1 hypervisor aimed at safe and efficient embedded real-time systems
              through virtualization, allowing different applications to share the same hardware platform through the isolation in time and space of these
              applications in partitions (TSP). Thanks to XtratuM, developers can build bare-metal applications or use different operating systems over the same
              platform, as well as to allocate applications with different criticality levels to each partition. The use of XtratuM is convenient for systems in
              which the main challenges deal with safety, the reuse of certified applications, dynamic software updates and size, weight, power and cost
              reduction of embedded safety-critical systems.


              XtratuM Next Generation is currently available to be run on top of a NOEL-V processor.

              Containerisation enables operating system-level virtualisation for running multiple identical or diverse executions. Each container functions as
              an isolated environment that runs independent executables, including native applications, background services (microservices), and even complete
              operating systems, thanks to virtualisation. ZAYA brings containerisation technology to (MMU-less) RISC-V microcontrollers and embedded systems,

              oreboot is a downstream fork of coreboot, i.e. oreboot is coreboot without 'c'.

              oreboot is mostly written in Rust, with assembly where needed.

              oreboot defaults to LinuxBoot payloads for a bootloader environment.

              SIM-V is our ultra-fast, functional RISC-V instruction set simulator. It enables you to verify your RISC-V software before hardware becomes
              available. Its rapid simulation speed reduces test runtimes, enabling your teams to reap detailed results sooner. All the while reducing energy
              consumption and saving time and money.

              The gem5 simulator is a modular platform for computer-system architecture research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor
              microarchitecture. The gem5 project is community-led with an open governance model. The gem5 simulator was originally conceived for computer
              architecture research in academia, but it has grown to be used in computer system design by academia, industry for research, and in teaching. The
              gem5 simulator contains cycle-level models for processors, cache hierarchies, memory systems, and devices. It can boot Linux and run most
              application for a variety of ISAs including Arm, RISC-V, and x86.

              RISCV-VP is a configurable and extensible platform to build Virtual Prototypes (VP) for RISC-V using C++/SystemC and TLM. Features include support
              for all standard RISC-V extension for the 32 and 64 bit architecture including the M/S/U privileged architecture, advanced software debugging
              capabilities using a GDB interface with an optional Eclipse GUI, a HiFive1 configuration and support for graphical environment models, and support
              for several operating systems including RIOT, Zephyr, FreeRTOS and Linux.


              The VP can be used for early Software development and verification, as well as Hardware design space exploration and prototyping on the basis of
              SystemC TLM 2.0.
